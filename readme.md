# LAMMPS Benchmark Experiment
## Description
### This experiment is intended to determin performance, optimization and energy consumptions of LAMMPS MD packet running on HPC computers, specificly sumpercomputer "cHARISMa", at the HSE University.
### The following stages have been completed so far:

1. Stage1: Running on HPC "cHARISMa" a basic water model TIP3P to determine usefull parameters and check performace of the HPC.
2. Stage2: Running on HPC "cHARISMa" standard benchmarks from LAMMPS website to compare performance.
3. Stage3: Running on HPC "cHARISMa" Lennad-Jones potential source file and compaare performance with different number of nodes, cores and gpus on HPC.
